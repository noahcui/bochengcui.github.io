    <b>Fault Tolerance Sharded K/V Storage System with MapReduce</b>
    <br>[<a href="https://github.com/noahcui/6.824">Code</a>]
    <br>
</div>

<ul>
    <li> A fault-tolerant K/V storage system that can serve a big chunk of data with low latency</li>
    <li>Simplified and implemented a Raft protocol.</li>
    <li>Designed and implemented sharding algorithm and shard controler. By default, it would split datas evenly on all
        edges. User can also decided the location for each shard of data as their need.</li>
    </li>
    <li>Designed and implemented data migrating algorithm. In my design, during the data migration, servers can still
        safely work and
        reply to clients.</li>
    <li>Introduced google map reduce to this system.</li>
</ul>
